          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>The HTML service lets you serve web pages that can interact with server-side Apps Script functions. 
             It is particularly useful for building web apps or adding custom user interfaces in Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms. 
             You can even use it to generate the body of an email.</p>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. 
             It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. 
             CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions,
             and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.</p>

               centrally and licenses it on a subscription basis. Ecommerce software providers employ this 
               model to enable businesses to save on infrastructure installation and maintenance costs,
